wolkgatewaymodule-modbus (0.8.1) stable; urgency=medium

      * Removed multi-value configurations as they have been disabled by the protocol.
      * Imported the newest MoreModbus that fixed strings and null characters.
      * Fixed the actuator status for readRestricted mappings.
      * Properly set the slave address in the mapping when actuator is being set.
      * Fixed data sending before the registration is sent out. Now we either wait 5s, or when a registration is returned.
      * Fixed all the release creation scripts, covering more architectures.
