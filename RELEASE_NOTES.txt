*WolkGatewayModule-Modbus RELEASE NOTES**
---------------------------------------

*Wolkabout Technology s.r.o.*

WolkGateway module for connecting Modbus devices to WolkAbout IoT Platform by communicating with WolkGateway.

**Version 0.6.0**
- [IMPROVEMENT] ModbusModule now uses MoreModbus as a dependency. MoreModbus is a library that contains logic for reading
                Modbus devices using mappings and groups, that allows values to be read in more types, such as 32-bit
                Integers, and Strings. With that, input deviceConfiguration.json file has changed a little bit, where
                HOLDING_REGISTER_ACTUATOR/SENSOR are not supported anymore, and are unified as HOLDING_REGISTER. Some output
                types have also changed.

**Version 0.5.0**
- [IMPROVEMENT] ModbusModule now registers multiple devices if the module targets multiple slave addresses.
                This includes addition of templates, devices are now assigned templates, and that determines
                registers and mappings that the device will have.

**Version 0.4.0**
- [IMPROVEMENT] ModbusModule can now register alarms and configurations for devices that connect to it.
                This is done using the key "mappingType" in devices json file.
- [IMPROVEMENT] ModbusModule also now allows mappings to take in multiple registers, this can be used to
                make multi-value numeric configurations to the platform.

**Version 0.3.1**
- [BUGFIX] Added logic to detect devices being disconnected, module will now try to reconnect when devices are disconnected
